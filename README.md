# CatLogger
> CatLogger is just a simple keylogger coded in python.
> It stores all in the log.txt file that it's created when CatLogger Runs
> The first release "CatLogger_1.0.zip" works only on windows computers, but we're working to make other release that work on both linux or windows, and with more feature like sendind the log.txt file by email (protonEmail)

# How Does it Work?
> CatLogger works thanks to "pynput" library, that can listen for keys to be pressed...
> The code is obliusly open source (It's located in the python folder), it's a simple project that anyone can do, and if you're studing python, I suggest you to take a look at the code, if you don't know what "__init__" or "self" means, learn it 'cause it's very important in python

# Requirements
> - Usb stick (CatLogger is not heavy you don't need 64 gb :), 4 gb are fine!)

> - Download the last version of CatLogger.zip and unzip it
